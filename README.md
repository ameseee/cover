# Cover

#### The need
Domestic abuse is prevalent in communities across the country and affect people of all backgrounds. Physical violence often comes with emotionally abusive and controlling behaviors. In the US, 1 in 3 women have been victim of some form of violence by an intimate partner, and 1 in 2 women have been victim of psychological abuse. It can be incredibly difficult for people in abusive relationships to get help, many times, due to fear of getting caught asking for help or trying to leave.

Cover is an app for people seeking help, whether it be an emergency or a friend to talk to. With the silent and quick click of one button, users can call for emergency services from 911. Users can send a custom text message to a contact, or if time is short, can send a pre-written text, including the users current location to any contact. All features eliminate the risk of their abuser seeing texts or calls from their phone/computer log.
